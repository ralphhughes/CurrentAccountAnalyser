# CurrentAccountAnalyser
Reads an export file from my bank, imports to SQLite and runs statistics SQL


# Goal
The end goal for this app is to able to run it once a week, have it download my statements from all accounts, update a SQLite database with the new records only, and then run statistics on the SQLite db to categorise where I'm spending my money, how my savings goals are doing and display an interactive sankey diagram showing flows of money in and out of my accounts.
